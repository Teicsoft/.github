Teicsoft in its current form was started at the end of 2023, when our group of friends and colleagues decided to set ourselves the challenge of developing a videogame, in a month, with little to no experience.

With a group of people spanning a wide variety of skillsets from programming to sound design, we set out and completed our first project, Gladiate!. 
Our main objective has been learning tooling and design, by doing. Then bringing skills and lessons learned into subsequent projects.

Currently publishing Gladiate!, and planning our next project.

## Projects
* [Gladiate!](https://github.com/Teicsoft/GLADIATE) Our first game dev project. A roguelike card battler that focuses on how cool your combos are.
