Teicsoft in its current form was started at the end of 2023, when our group of friends and colleagues decided to set ourselves the challenge of developing a videogame, in a month, with little to no experience.

With a group of people spanning a wide variety of skillsets from programming to sound design, we set out and completed our first project, [Gladiate!](https://github.com/Teicsoft/GLADIATE). 
Our main objective has been learning tooling and design, by doing. Then bringing skills and lessons learned into subsequent projects.

Currently publishing [Gladiate!](https://github.com/Teicsoft/GLADIATE), and planning our next project.
